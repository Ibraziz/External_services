  "summary": "This document is the first page of a Finnish Deed of Sale (Kauppakirja). It identifies the parties involved: the Seller, the City of Espoo, and the Buyer, whose information is left blank. The document states that the City Council's Business and Competitiveness Division made the final decision on the sale on May 6, 2024, under section 42.  The second page identifies the target of the sale as a specific plot of land in Espoo, including its property ID, surface area, and address. The transaction price is also stated on this page.  Pages 3-3 detail the payment terms of the sale, specifying a 2000 euro retaining fee already paid and the remaining balance due upon signing. It also clarifies that ownership and possession of the property transfer upon full payment.  The document further states that there are no existing mortgages or liens on the property. Finally, it outlines the City's right to establish easements and restrictions on the property for municipal purposes, with compensation provided for any resulting damage. Pages 4-4 detail the encumbrances on the property. The city reserves the right to set up encumbrances for utility lines free of charge and to place embankments, cuts, and other structures on the site for municipal purposes, compensating the buyer for any damage. The parties are responsible for taxes and other charges on the land for the duration of their ownership. The buyer has inspected the plot and compared its features with the provided documents, finding no issues. Pages 5-5 state that the buyer has reviewed the land documents and the layout maps and regulations for neighboring properties. The seller is responsible for any pre-existing soil contamination up to the level required by the town plan, but the primary responsibility lies with the party who caused the contamination. The seller is not aware of any soil contamination on the property. If contamination is found, the buyer must contact the City of Espoo's land unit before taking any action. The city will only cover additional costs related to cleaning up the contamination if all cleaning measures have been agreed upon with the land unit before implementation. The buyer is responsible for removing any minor debris present on the property before the sale at their own expense. Pages 6-6 further clarify the responsibilities regarding soil contamination. The buyer is responsible for removing any minor debris on the site prior to the transaction at their own expense. The buyer is also obligated to build on the site a building (or buildings) with a floor area of at least 70% of the amount of the building right on the site, approved by the building control authority. The buyer is responsible for carrying out the soil surveys related to the design of the construction project and for the structural solutions required by the soil related to the implementation of the project. The preliminary feasibility study carried out by the seller is not sufficient for the final construction plans. The buyer is obliged to find out the cables that may be located at the place of sale. The buyer is responsible for the costs arising from any necessary cable transfers.  Pages 7-7 outline a contractual penalty if the buyer transfers the land to a third party before fulfilling the construction obligation without the seller's consent. The buyer would have to pay the seller the full purchase price as compensation. This page also clarifies that no movables or buildings are included in the sale. Pages 8-8 show the signatures of the seller, buyer, and notary for the trade confirmation. Pages 9-9 include the notary's certificate confirming the signing of the deed and the identities of the parties involved. ",
